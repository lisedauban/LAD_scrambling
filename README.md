# General information
This folder contains information about the pipelines used in the manuscript "Genome - nuclear lamina interactions are multivalent and cooperative" by Dauban et al.. 
Are detailed pipelines to:
- process tagmentation data
- process pA-DamID data
- generate domainograms

The Figure folder contains scripts used to generate figures.


# Detail about the samples
For the sake of clarity we simplified the recombination nomenclature in the manuscript. Because different names were used in raw and processed data, we link here the names used in the raw and processed data to those used in the manuscript.
