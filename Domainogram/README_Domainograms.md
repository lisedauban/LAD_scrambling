# Domainograms of genomic deletions or inversions 
The pipeline to generate domainograms upon genomic deletions or inversions. This was used for recombination d1-6, i7-10, d11, i12 and for the CRISPR deletion of R4-5. It can be found here: https://github.com/vansteensellab/domainograms/blob/dauban_etal/plot_domainograms.R



# Domainograms of genomic inversions and deletions combined
This pipeline was used upon isolation of R4-5 or R2-3 in an iLAD or close to LAD4: https://github.com/vansteensellab/domainograms/blob/dauban_etal/plot_domainograms_combined_recombination.R



The "script" folder contains command line used to generate domainograms
